## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This is just the desktop version, i will continue development for the mobile version too.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me to understand flexbox properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward
